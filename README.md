This is the course project. This project uses the server arranged by the professor.
For this website, I try to design the program like an online Market. I called it Flea Market.
User can upload the item that they want to sell or search the thing that they want to buy. Also, it supposes that people log in by the account (username: longge password: 12345). 
In My profile, there are two functions, upload and review. For the upload function, user need to complete the information of the selling item. For the review function, user can review what the item does user upload.
